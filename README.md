# Knowledge Distillation 

This repo has the work presented to my NLP research group, introducing the concept of Knowledge distillation.

Currently this repo contains

 - Presentation file in pdf format
 - Code demo used for discussing the softmax function and the effect of temperature

The code for code demo can be easily opened in colab by clicking here [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vmenan/knowledge-distillation/blob/main/Effect_of_Temperature_in_Softmax.ipynb)

TODO

 - Add code demoing the distillation for image classification.
 - Add code demoing the distillation for speech classification task.
 - Add code demoing distillation for machine translation task.
